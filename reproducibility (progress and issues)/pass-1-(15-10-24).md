# First Pass Details

# Experiment Reproduction Guide

## üìå Progress  
- Understood the **folder structure and pipeline**.  
- Successfully **preprocessed logs**.  
- Generated **graphs from preprocessed logs** and used `graph_reader.py` to generate the **sequence graph**.  
- Created **sampled datasets** by modifying variables in `atlas.py`.  
- **Trained the model** using the sampled datasets.  
- Completed **testing and evaluation** of the model.

## üìå Issues  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Parsing Issue with DOT Files  
- **Issue:** Errors encountered while parsing DOT files.  
- **Fix:** Used files from **Jaffer‚Äôs repository**, which resolved the parsing issue.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Files from `paper_experiments` Folder  
- **Issue:** Had to manually locate and copy certain log-related files (`ips`, `malicious_labels`, `user_artifact`) from `paper_experiments` into the correct folders.  

- **Files Copied:**  
  - **For S1:**
    ```
    paper_experiments/S1/training_logs/S2/ips
    paper_experiments/S1/training_logs/S2/malicious_labels
    paper_experiments/S1/training_logs/S2/user_artifact
    paper_experiments/S1/training_logs/S3/ips
    paper_experiments/S1/training_logs/S3/malicious_labels
    paper_experiments/S1/training_logs/S3/user_artifact
    paper_experiments/S1/training_logs/S4/ips
    paper_experiments/S1/training_logs/S4/malicious_labels
    paper_experiments/S1/training_logs/S4/user_artifact
    paper_experiments/S1/testing_logs/S1/ips
    paper_experiments/S1/testing_logs/S1/malicious_labels
    paper_experiments/S1/testing_logs/S1/user_artifact
    ```
  - **For S2, S3, S4, similar files were copied from `paper_experiments/S2`, `S3`, and `S4` respectively.**  
  - **For M1 - M6:**
    ```
    paper_experiments/M1/h1/training_logs/M2/h1/ips
    paper_experiments/M1/h1/training_logs/M2/h1/malicious_labels
    paper_experiments/M1/h1/training_logs/M2/h1/user_artifact
    paper_experiments/M1/h1/training_logs/M2/h2/ips
    paper_experiments/M1/h1/training_logs/M2/h2/malicious_labels
    paper_experiments/M1/h1/training_logs/M2/h2/user_artifact
    paper_experiments/M1/h1/testing_logs/M1/h1/ips
    paper_experiments/M1/h1/testing_logs/M1/h1/malicious_labels
    paper_experiments/M1/h1/testing_logs/M1/h1/user_artifact
    ```
  - **For M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, similar files were copied from the corresponding folders.**  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Difference in Predicted Entities  
- **Issue:** Discrepancy between expected and actual results in the **predicted entities**.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) are 0 in Evaluation  
- **Issue:** Running evaluation on my dataset resulted in **0 FP and FN**, while the provided evaluation dataset showed **some FP values**.  
- **Action Taken:** Raised an issue on **GitHub**, awaiting further clarification.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Unclear Folder Structure and File Usage  
- **Issue:** The **`paper_experiments`** folder contains the author's results for each experiment but does not explain the required structure for reproduction.  
- **Resolution:** Followed the structure from `paper_experiments`, ensuring consistency with the provided results.  


### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Multiple `malicious_labels` Files for One Log**  
- **Issue:**  
  - Found **multiple `malicious_labels` files** for the same log in several training log folders.  
  - Example: In **training logs of S1 in S2**, different versions of the file were present:  
    ```
    malicious_labels
    malicious_labels (copy)
    malicious_labels (another copy)
    ```
  - This caused confusion in selecting the correct file for processing.

- **Resolution:**  
  - Chose the file **named exactly** as `malicious_labels`.  
  - **Ignored duplicate versions** like `malicious_labels (copy)` or `malicious_labels (another copy)`.  
  - Ensured **consistent selection across all training log folders** to match the expected dataset structure.
