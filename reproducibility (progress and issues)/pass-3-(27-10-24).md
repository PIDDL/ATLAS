### **Experiments Issues & Results â€“ Pass 3**  

## **ðŸ“Œ Issues & Fixes**  

### **ðŸ›‘ 1. Getting 0 False Positives (FP) and 0 False Negatives (FN) in Evaluation**  
- **Issue:**  
  - Despite using the **preprocessed logs**, **resampled dataset**, and **trained model**, the evaluation consistently showed **0 FP and 0 FN**.  
  - This indicated a discrepancy between **predicted entities** and expected ground truth.  

- **Fix:**  
  - **Copied the predicted entities** from the terminal output after running ATLAS for testing.  
  - **Manually cleaned** the predicted entities following the **instructions given in the author's README**.  
  - Re-ran the evaluation after cleaning.  

---

### **ðŸ›‘ 2. Vague Instructions for Cleaning Predicted Entities**  
- **Issue:**  
  - The author's README provides **unclear** instructions on how to **properly clean the predicted entities** before evaluation.  
  - A **GitHub issue (#23)** was posted regarding this **(https://github.com/purseclab/ATLAS/issues/23)**, but no response was received.  
  - Due to the lack of clarity, it was difficult to determine the **correct approach** for entity selection.  

- **Fix:**  
  - Followed the **README instructions as much as possible** and applied **logical filtering** based on:  
    - **Removing redundant entities** (e.g., `"payload.exe"` and `"payload.exe_892"` were considered the same).  
    - **Including related entities** when applicable (e.g., `"0xalsaheel.com"` â†’ `"192.168.223.3"` if linked in logs).  
  - This ensured the **cleaned predictions were as close as possible** to expected results.

## **ðŸ“Œ Results**  
The results below are obtained by running and reproducing **ATLAS end-to-end**, including:  
- **Processing logs**  
- **Generating graphs**  
- **Training the model**  
- **Testing and evaluation**  

These results compare **entity-level predictions** and **event-level predictions** for different experiments (S1-S4, M1-M6).

### âœ… **Final Notes**  
- The issue of **0 FP and 0 FN** was resolved **by manually cleaning predicted entities** before evaluation.  
- **Vague instructions** in the author's README made it unclear **how exactly to clean entities**, so **logical assumptions were made**.  
- The **GitHub issue (#23)** remains unresolved.
