# **Second Pass Details – Progress After Meeting on 16-10-24**  

## **🟢 Training & Testing Progress**
- Ran **training on their resampled dataset** and tested with:
  - **Preprocessed testing sequence graph**
  - **Preprocessed logs**
- **Result:** Still getting **0 False Positives (FPs)** and **0 False Negatives (FNs)**.  

### **🔹 Testing with Their Trained Model**
- Now using **their trained model** with the same files for testing.  
- **Result:** Still getting **0 FPs** and **0 FNs**.

### **2️⃣ My Predicted Entities**  
![My Predicted Entities](images/my%20predicted.png)  

### **📌 Key Observations**  
- **Their evaluation file** shows **fewer predicted entities** compared to mine.  
- **My predicted entities** have **higher probabilities**, suggesting **my model is more accurate** when running `evaluate.py`.

### **2️⃣ My Resampled Dataset**  
![My Resampled Dataset](images/my%20resampled.png)  

### **📌 Key Differences**
- **File size for the resampled dataset** differs from theirs.  
- **My training time is shorter** compared to theirs.  

---

## **📌 Next Steps**
- Reproducing **their paper experiments** (`S3` for now) to check:  
  - Any **changes in evaluation results**.  
  - **Differences in training, testing, and evaluation metrics**.  

---

## **📊 Reproducing Experiment S4 (Using Their Paper Experiments)**
- Used **their paper experiment files**.  
- Trained and tested on **their dataset**.  
- Results below:

### **📌 Summary of Findings**
- **Discrepancy in entity prediction** and dataset size compared to their results.  
- **Their trained model still produces 0 FP & FN**, similar to mine.  
- **Reproducing their experiments (S3 & others) will help identify inconsistencies.**
